## This Blog

This site is completely self-hosted on my homelab using a full GitOps workflow:

- Written in Obsidian
- Built with Hugo
- Deployed via GitHub webhooks
- Served by Caddy with automatic HTTPS
- Infrastructure managed with OpenTofu and Ansible

Everything is version-controlled and reproducible!
